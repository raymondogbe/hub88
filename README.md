### Jump-host Project

This project uses **Terraform** to provision AWS infrastructure and **Ansible** to configure services on EC2 instances. The infrastructure includes a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**, private and public subnets across 2 Availability Zones (AZs), EC2 instances, a **Bastion Host (jump host)**, an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, and Dockerized **Nginx** services running on each EC2 instance. Additionally, Docker logs are delivered to AWS **CloudWatch** for centralized logging and monitoring.

### Overview

This project automates the setup and configuration of AWS infrastructure using **Terraform** and **Ansible**. The architecture includes:

- A **VPC** with private and public subnets across 2 Availability Zones (AZs).
- Three **EC2 instances** for application hosting.
- A **Jumphost** (Bastion Host) for secure access to the private instances.
- An **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** that distributes traffic across EC2 instances.
- **IAM** roles and policies for EC2 instances and CloudWatch access.
- **Dockerized Nginx instances** running on each EC2 instance with different `index.html` files.
- **CloudWatch logging** for Docker container logs.

---

### Key Technologies

- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- **Ansible** for service configuration.
- **Docker** for containerizing the Nginx service.
- **AWS** EC2, VPC, ALB, IAM, and CloudWatch.

---

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- **Terraform**: For provisioning AWS infrastructure.
- **Ansible**: For configuration management and deployment.
- **AWS CLI**: For managing AWS resources.
- **Docker**: For containerizing applications.
- **Jenkins** (optional): For automating the Terraform and Ansible workflow.

You also need:

- An **AWS account** with sufficient permissions to manage EC2 instances, VPCs, IAM roles, and CloudWatch logs.
- AWS credentials configured locally or through environment variables.

### Setup Instructions

#### Terraform Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Jump-host.git
   cd Jump-host
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Plan the Terraform Execution:
   ```bash
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   ```

4. Apply the Terraform Plan:
   ```bash
   terraform apply tfplan
   ```
   This will create the necessary resources, such as the VPC, subnets, EC2 instances, ALB, IAM roles, and policies.

#### Ansible Setup

1. **Inventory Generation**: Terraform dynamically generates the Ansible inventory file (`inventory.ini`) based on the infrastructure it provisions.

2. **Ansible Configuration**: The Ansible configuration (`ansible.cfg`) is generated automatically by Terraform and is tailored to use the Bastion Hostâ€™s IP for SSH access.

3. **Run Ansible Playbook**: Once Terraform provisions the infrastructure, the Ansible playbook is automatically executed by Terraform through the `null_resource` with a remote-exec provisioner. This will:
   - Install Docker and Nginx on each EC2 instance.
   - Deploy an Nginx Docker container on each instance with a unique `index.html` file.

To run manually:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```

#### Docker Logs to CloudWatch

1. **Docker Logging Driver**: Configure the `awslogs` driver for Docker containers in the playbook to ensure logs are pushed to CloudWatch.

2. **CloudWatch Configuration**: Ensure the EC2 instances have appropriate IAM roles to send logs to CloudWatch.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Terraform Infrastructure

1. **VPC**: A custom VPC is created with a CIDR block of `10.161.0.0/24`. This ensures that the network is logically isolated, providing flexibility to create subnets and configure routing and security.

2. **Subnets**: Private and public subnets are created following best practices for high availability and fault tolerance. These subnets are distributed across two Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure redundancy.

   - **Private Subnets**:
     - `10.161.0.154`
     - `10.161.0.148`
     - `10.161.0.156`

   These subnets are located in different AZs for high availability. By placing instances in private subnets, they are shielded from direct internet access, enhancing security.

3. **EC2 Instances**: Three EC2 instances are provisioned in the private subnets, and one Bastion Host is created in a public subnet for secure access to the private instances.

   - **Bastion Host**: This is the only instance with public access, acting as a jump server to securely SSH into the private EC2 instances.

   - **Private EC2 Instances**: These are isolated in private subnets, preventing direct access from the internet and improving security.

4. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: The ALB distributes incoming traffic across the EC2 instances on port 80. It performs health checks to ensure that traffic is only routed to healthy instances.

5. **IAM Roles**: Custom IAM roles are created to allow EC2 instances to interact with CloudWatch logs securely, enabling centralized logging for troubleshooting and monitoring.

#### Ansible Configuration

The Ansible playbook automates the installation of Docker and Nginx on the EC2 instances. It also ensures that each instance serves a unique `index.html` page through Docker containers. The following was done to simplify the process:

- **Automating Ansible Installation**: Initially, I considered running the Ansible playbook locally, but this would require each user to install Ansible. To solve this, I used Terraform to provision the Bastion Host and ensure that Ansible runs directly on it, eliminating the need for users to set up Ansible locally.

- **Python and Ansible Fixes**: Since the EC2 instances initially had Python 2.7, I upgraded it to Python 3. I also configured Ansible to use Python 3 by default (`interpreter_python = /usr/bin/python3`).

---

### Testing Experience

While working on the project, I encountered several issues:

- **Terraform Delay**: During one of the runs, I noticed a significant delay in Terraform execution. By enabling debug mode (`terraform apply -debug`), I discovered that the process was stuck due to a permission problem. Specifically, Terraform was trying to move my SSH key to the specified location, but it didn't have the proper permissions. After identifying the issue, I adjusted the permissions, and the problem was resolved.

- **Ansible Failures**: When running Ansible, I faced multiple failures. By increasing the verbosity (`ansible-playbook -vvv`), I was able to trace the issue to Ansible not properly recognizing my SSH key. Once I addressed the SSH configuration, the playbook ran smoothly.

---

### Jenkins Integration

Jenkins automates the entire CI/CD pipeline, ensuring seamless provisioning and deployment:

1. **Checkout Code**: The pipeline pulls the latest code from the Git repository.
2. **Terraform Init/Plan/Apply**: These stages handle Terraform initialization, planning, and resource provisioning.
3. **Terraform Destroy**: This cleans up resources after testing or when no longer needed.

Jenkins ensures that the process is fully automated, reducing human error and improving workflow efficiency.

---

### Source of Information

To build this solution, I relied on the following resources:

- **Google**: Terraform documentation and other online resources.
- **Terraform Documentation**: [Terraform AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)
- **YouTube**: Videos on Terraform best practices.
- **Manuals**: Official documentation for Terraform and Ansible.
  - [Terraform AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)
  - [Ansible AWS Collection](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws/index.html)

These resources were instrumental in shaping the infrastructure design and ensuring that the environment was properly configured for seamless deployment and management.

### Suggested Improvements

- **Auto Scaling**: To enhance availability and fault tolerance, adding **auto-scaling** capabilities to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on traffic load could make the system more resilient and cost-efficient. With auto-scaling, new EC2 instances can be spun up when traffic increases, and unnecessary instances can be terminated when demand decreases.
